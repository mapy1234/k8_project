Building and containerizing the micro-services
The two micro-services we will deploy here are called system and inventory. The system micro-service returns the JVM system properties of the running container and it returns the podâ€™s name in the HTTP header making replicas easy to distinguish from each other. The inventory micro-service adds the properties from the system micro-service to the inventory. This process demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.
